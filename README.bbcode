[size=6][b]Difficulty Tweaks Mod for Fast Food Simulator[/b][/size]

The Difficulty Tweaks Mod for `Fast Food Simulator`, dynamically adjusts various game play elements to elevate the game's challenge. It scales customer numbers based on restaurant level and days played, decreases customer patience as more customers are seated and waiting, and adjusts eating duration based on seating. An in-game command system also allows for real-time adjustments.
